# ModDragnilarEdit
</br>
This is a mod for the Witcher 3 for the PC that contains a bunch of my own personal tweaks for the game.
</br>
The majority of the changes revolve around making the skills more interesting and requiring less skill point investment, somewhat similar to Witcher 1.
</br></br>
For example, all of the skills are now usable at once and provide some type of passive bonus. Various adjustments still need to be made to monsters and/or other factors due to the fact that Geralt is overall far more powerful.
</br>
</br>
As alluded to up above, Monsters / NPCs are adjusted likewise to be more powerful at levels 90+ due to the fact that Geralt is overall more powerful. Other adjustments are being made as well, some of which are inspired by Ghost Mode and/or other mods.
</br>
Another notable change is that Aerondight has been greatly improved in a number of ways. The most significant is that it now works on both humans and monsters. I also plan to add some other things regarding Aerondight, including being able to upgrade it via blacksmiths.
</br>
</br>
Another significant change is that mutagens have been altered so that they can provide passive effects while equipped (other than the synergy bonuses). 
</br>
</br>
<p>-Initially I wanted to have all of the unique mutagens apply their effects while equipped, but after some toying around I felt that it would be better to change the effects on pre-existing ones that are already used for decoctions and add new ones for the unique aspect</p>
</br>

<b>Other Modifications Used/Incorporated</b>
</br>
This lists any of the significant modifications from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/">Nexus Mods</A> that I integrated and/or used for inspiration:
<br>
<list>
<li>Jump in Shallow Water</li>
<li>Some adjustments from Ghost Mode, primarily "Clear Develop" for debugging purposes.</li>
<li>Some adjustments from FCR3, mainly bug fixes for monster damage (I.E. Monster projectiles doing percentages of Geralt's life regardless of DR)</li>
<li>The Yrden Rend Spell from Magic Spells for Signs and Weapons; Rend felt underwhelming without it.</li>
<li>Elly's "All Skills At Once" mod.</li>
<li>Auto Apply Oils for enhancing oil based skills.</li>
</list>
