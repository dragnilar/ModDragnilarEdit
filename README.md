This is a mod for the Witcher 3 for the PC that contains a bunch of my own personal tweaks for the game.
</br>
The majority of the changes revolve around making the skills more interesting and requiring less skill point investment, somewhat similar to Witcher 1.
</br>
For example, all of the skills are now usable at once and provide some type of passive bonus. Skills are being adjusted to reduce power spike.
</br>
Monsters / NPCs are adjusted likewise to be more powerful at levels 90+ due to the fact that Geralt is overall more powerful. However the player will most likely still feel significantly powerful even at such high levels.
</br>
Another notable change is that Aerondight has been greatly improved in a number of ways. The most significant is that it now works on both humans and monsters.
</br>
The other change that should probably be noted is that a lot of the damage reduction bonuses on armor and from protective coating have been reduced.
</br>
</br>
Note: A number of the tweaks include merges from other mods found over at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/">Nexus Mods</A>.
<br>
These are the following mods that I merged into my own and then may or may not have further edited:
<br>
<list>
<li>Ultimate Yrden (my own tweaks conflicted and thus it was simpler to merge)</li>
<li>Jump in Shallow Water</li>
<li>Some adjustments from Ghost Mode, primarily "Clear Develop" for debugging purposes</li>
<li>Elly's "All Skills At Once" mod</li>
</list>
