# ModDragnilarEdit
</br>
This is a mod for the Witcher 3 for the PC that contains a bunch of my own personal tweaks for the game.
</br>
The vast majority of these tweaks could be considered cheating (at present) due to their experimental nature or absurdly high numbers. 
</br>
</br>
Note: A number of the tweaks include merges from other mods found over at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/">Nexus Mods</A>.
<br>
These are the following mods that I merged into my own and then may or may not have further edited:
<br>
<list>
<li>Ultimate Yrden (my own tweaks conflicted and thus it was simpler to merge)</li>
<li>Jump in Shallow Water (simply done to consolodate mods)</li>
<li>Additional Alchemy (merged due to script conflicts/tweaks made to the mod itself).</li>
<li>Bits and pieces have been taken from Ghost Mode (I.E. Damage formula changes, etc).</li>
</list>
