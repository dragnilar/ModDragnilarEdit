# ModDragnilarEdit
</br>
This is a mod for the Witcher 3 for the PC that contains a bunch of my own personal tweaks for the game.
</br>
The vast majority of these tweaks could be considered tweaks and/or changes that make Geralt overpowered. 
</br>
</br>
Note: A number of the tweaks include merges from other mods found over at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/">Nexus Mods</A>.
<br>
These are the following mods that I merged into my own and then may or may not have further edited:
<br>
<list>
<li>Ultimate Yrden (my own tweaks conflicted and thus it was simpler to merge)</li>
<li>Slots Slots Slots (done to consolodate mods and simplify merging)</li>
<li>Jump in Shallow Water (simply done to consolodate mods)</li>
<li>Increased Running/Sprint Speed (scripts are only used for the Werewolf Decoction).</li>
</list>
